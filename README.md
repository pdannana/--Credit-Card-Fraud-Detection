🕵️‍♂️🔍 Project Methodology:    Credit Card Fraud Detection 🚨💳


🎯 Objective:

Catch those sneaky fraudulent transactions!

🚀 Steps & Procedures:

->📂 Data Collection:

Grabbed a dataset with transaction details 🗂️.
🧹 Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the data and handled any missing bits 🛠️.
Normalized Amount 💸 for better model performance.
Split into training and testing sets ✂️.


-->🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed transaction amounts 📊.
Visualized transaction trends over time 📈.
Examined feature relationships with scatter plots 🔎.
1)⚖️ Class Balancing:

Used SMOTE to balance the classes 🧪.

2)🤖 Model Building:

Picked XGBoost for its power ⚡.
Trained on the balanced data 💪.

3)📊 Model Evaluation:

Checked accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC 📈.
Created a confusion matrix heatmap 🌡️.

🎨 Visualization:
